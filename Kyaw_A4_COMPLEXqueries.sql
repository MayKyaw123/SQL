QUESTION 2
I chose to utilize a subquery because Iâ€™m more confident operating with them rather
than CTEs.
When I initially began to use subqueries, it was quite useful to consider how the
subquery
itself informs the major query. I enjoy operating with a subquery for this question
because
I could break each part down into more diminutive, manageable steps.
